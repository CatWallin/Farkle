1. update in updateDiceImg() so the image is the value of the dice not the dice number
2. Fixed dice click so the clicked property is properly set
3. Created a function for the end of each roll to check for a Farkle!
4. Created a getScore() to calculate the score and add then display it!
5. created a bankScore() to add score to the player total!

* can get rid of checkForFarkle() and add a check for 0 instead inside of getScore()
